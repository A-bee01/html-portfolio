<h2>I am Abundance, Ab for short.</h2>

<p>I am a web developer who loves to code and create websites. I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am also learning how to use GitHub and Git. I am excited to learn more about web development and become a professional web developer.</p>
<p>In my free time, I love to create videos of myself singing or just doing random things.</p>
<p>Fun fact about me? I like to tell myself I do not have OCD meanwhile I have some of its symptoms. </p>

<p>I graduated high school and I am currently in my 4th year in college, studying Mechanical Engineering.</p>
